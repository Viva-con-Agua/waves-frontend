        As a way of saying thanks to the people who contribute to reddit, a set of daily reddit trophies was established in late 2009. Each night at midnight (PT), the trophies are calculated for the previous day and the winners listed on our honor roll. Also, each winner receives a trophy on their user page as a token of having won.
        What's the difference between an award and a trophy?
        Awards and trophies are now distinctly different concepts. Awards include Silver, Gold and Platinum, which users can give one another to recognize high quality content. You can learn more about Awards here.
        Trophies are honors bestowed by Reddit for worthy contributions; for example, to commemorate a user with the “Translator” trophy for excellence in language translations, or the “White Hat” trophy for catching a bug and responsibly reporting to our admins.

      <h3>Can you create a new trophy for me / my community?</h3>
      <p>We'd like to keep trophies prestigious, and if we just give them out willy-nilly it defeats the whole purpose, it would be madness. That said, if you have a suggestion for one, we're open to new ideas, especially if the award will have broad appeal across all of reddit.</p>
      <h3>How can I get a trophy?</h3>
      <p>
        The first rule of trophies is you don't talk about trophies.
        (Rules 2 to ∞ are simply repetitions of this first one, with increasing levels of emphasis.)
        Please note:
        Trophies do not get deleted if you delete the comment attached to the trophy in question.
